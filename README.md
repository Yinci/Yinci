### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Yinci's the name and coding is the game! I'm a Dutch developer who enjoys creating applications and software to make life easier. I prefer doing backend work, but if needed, frontend is also in my skillset. I focus on writing code that's readable and maintainable. If it's not readable, then another developer might have trouble working with my code, and that should never be the case.
